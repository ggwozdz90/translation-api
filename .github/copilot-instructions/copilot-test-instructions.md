# Best Practices and Python Testing Principles

1. **Test Naming**:
   - Use descriptive names for test functions that clearly indicate what is being tested.
   - Follow a clear pattern, such as `test_functionality_scenario`.

2. **Given-When-Then Structure**:
   - Structure your tests using the Given-When-Then format.
     - **Given**: Set up the initial context or state.
     - **When**: Execute the action or function being tested.
     - **Then**: Assert the expected outcome.

3. **Use of Fixtures**:
   - Utilize pytest fixtures to set up any necessary configurations, dependencies, or mock objects.

4. **Mocking**:
   - Use `unittest.mock` or similar libraries to mock external dependencies and functions.

## Coverage of Class Code

- Ensure that the tests cover the main functionality of the class or function being tested.
- Include tests for:
  - **Success Scenarios**: Verify that the function behaves as expected under normal conditions.
  - **Failure Scenarios**: Verify that the function handles errors and exceptions gracefully.
  - **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and unusual inputs.
- Avoid redundant tests that do not add value or test the same functionality multiple times.

## Workarounds and Code Quality

- Avoid workarounds or anti-patterns in the test code.
- Ensure that the test code is straightforward and readable.

## Example Test Code

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock

@pytest.fixture
def mock_dependency() -> Mock:
    return Mock()

def test_example_function(mock_dependency: Mock) -> None:
    # Given
    mock_dependency.some_method.return_value = "expected_result"
    
    # When
    result = example_function(mock_dependency)
    
    # Then
    assert result == "expected_result"
    mock_dependency.some_method.assert_called_once()
```
